# Global Rules

## These rules and settings apply to all Ark PvE servers:

1. ### **DO NOT** block player spawns.
   - If you have a player spawn inside your base, you __**MUST**__ make sure that there is an easy and obvious path out from your base.

2. ### **DO NOT** block loot crate, beacon spawns, and explorer notes or impede access to them by other players.
   - Structures can be subject to removal without warning

3. ### **DO NOT** build or block access to the following restricted locations:
   -  **Aberration:**
      * Surface Access Points

   -  **Center:**
      * Skull Island (Obsidian, Metal & Crystal)
      * Penguin Iceberg at Green Obelisk (Organic Polymer)
      * Ice Palace underneath Green Obelisk (Organic Polymer)

   -  **Extinction:**

4. ### **DO NOT** bring flyers to the Aberration map. 
    - Any non-native flyers on Aberration will be immediately destroyed on sight by admins.

5. ### **DO NOT** cheat or exploit bugs in the game or mods. 
    - These include using indestructible player-crafted structures to create choke points or modify the root map design.

6. ### **NO** excessive cursing, racism or hate speech in global chat or on the server Discord which extends to aliases and character names.  
    - If an argument needs to happen, take it to private messages.

7. ### **NO** griefing, trolling, or harrassing other players. 
    - This also extends to stealing from other's containers, killing players and dinos, kiting aggressive dinos to someone's base or interrupting tames.

8. ### **DO NOT** let your tamed dinos wander outside of your base.
    - Violations may result in destruction of tribe dinos without warning if the problem is bad enough.

9. ### **NO** foundation, pillar or structure spam. 
    - **Only build where you are active.**

## **Territory Claims**

* Each tribe is allowed up to a maximum of 8000 structures on the map.

* Outposts should be limited to barebone basics and must be regularly used.

When starting a base or expanding a build, ensure that you are not blocking in another tribe's base. Please do not build too close to an already existing tribe. Please build at a distance that leaves ample room for expansion for both parties.

Do not block natural resources, paths or obelisks with permanent structures. Ensure that your build does not severly cripple dino spawns especially in tight spaces like caves.

**Note: You CAN build within render of other bases.**

## **Tribe Wars**

While the server is primarily focused on PvE, we **DO** offer the ability for tribes to go to war with each other.  Should you and another tribe decide you'd like to declare war, there will be limitations set by both parties and those agreed upon limitations must be followed.

---

## **Super Breeds**

Super Breeds are defined as any dino with a base level of over 800. These dinos have been bred to have the highest values in at least 2 stats. Super Breed dinos are the property of the breeder and can only be traded, gifted, bred or used in boss fights at the original breeder's discretion. If caught with a Super Breed line that is not yours, the dinos will be removed from your possession and additional punishments will follow based on the severity of the violation.

**DO NOT** cross-breed supers with regular tames.
  - Breeders Responsibilities:
    - Be cautious as to who you issue your super bred dinos to.
    - IF a super bred dino is involved in griefing - it will be destroyed.
  - Breeders Rights:
    - Issue/Exchange their super breeds with whomever they wish.
    - There are no limitations to what you can breed.

Please reference [this forum category](https://www.supremegaming.gg/forums/category/15/pve-super-breeding-registration) for the list of registered Super Breeds and their authorised users.

## **Violations & Punishments**

Violations that originate from toxic behaviour will more often times result in an immediate and permanent ban. For other smaller recurring violations, admins reserve the right to issue punishments at their discretion.

If rules are being violated then you must submit proof before asking an admin to investigate. Proof can be in the form of relevant screenshots (F12 while in game to capture screen via Steam) or in the form of video if you are able to do so. Do not come to use asking for someone to be punished without proof. Do **_NOT_** leave out details just to help your case. Admins do not take kindly to lying.

You can report a violation on the [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/supremegaming) and creating a support ticket in any channel by sending a message containing `!ticket new`.

## **Additional Notes**

The Craftable Tribute Terminal mod allows players to create an obelisk terminal to place in their base in order to make transfers between servers more convenient.

_Be responsible with the pillars and terminals you place down. They are not demolishable by anybody else but the tribe that placed them. We admins do not have the time to go around and cleaning out terminals whenever they are abandoned and someone else wants to build where they are placed. If you place a tribute terminal please pick it up after you are done transferring/transporting items or creatures._
