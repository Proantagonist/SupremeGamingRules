# Global Rules

## Language

While we understand sometimes an expletive is the best way to get your feelings across, please keep it to a minimum. Players and staff will ask you to watch your language if it becomes disruptive, so please respect their wishes. 

However, using foul language as an insult to other players is unacceptable and will be addressed by an admin as soon as we can. Please remember we can see all chat from game in Discord.<br>

## Toxicity

While "trash talk" is many times an aspect of PvP and even sometimes PvE, if it reaches a level of you being a toxic player, you will be addessed by an admin to be mindful of your chat. If your behaviour continues to degrade or you begin to destroy the friendly and respectful environment we wish to achieve, _you will be removed_.<br>

## Building Regulations & Guidelines:<br>

1. ### **DO NOT** block player spawns.
   - If you have a player spawn inside your base, you __**MUST**__ make sure that there is an easy and obvious path out from your base.

    - **Only build where you are active.**

    - _Dino Traps_ are to be removed as soon as **YOU**, their builder, are done using them.

## **Territory Claims**

* Each tribe is allowed up to a maximum of 8000 structures on the map.

* Outposts should be limited to barebone basics and must be regularly used.

When starting a base or expanding a build, ensure that you are not blocking in another tribe's base. Please do not build too close to an already existing tribe. Please build at a distance that leaves ample room for expansion for both parties.

Do not block natural resources, paths or obelisks with permanent structures. Ensure that your build does not severly cripple dino spawns especially in tight spaces like caves.

**Note: You CAN build within render of other bases.**

## **Tribe Wars**

While the server is primarily focused on PvE, we **DO** offer the ability for tribes to go to war with each other.  Should you and another tribe decide you'd like to declare war, there will be limitations set by both parties and those agreed upon limitations must be followed.

---

## **Super Breeds**

Super Breeds are defined as any dino with a base level of over 800. These dinos have been bred to have the highest values in at least 2 stats. Super bred dinos are the property of the breeder and can only be traded, gifted, bred or used in boss fights at the original breeder's discretion. If caught with a Super Breed line that is not yours, the dinos will be removed from your possession and additional punishments will follow based on the severity of the violation.

**DO NOT** cross-breed supers with regular tames.
  - Breeders Responsibilities:
    - Be mindful as to who you issue your super bred dinos to.
    - IF a super bred dino is involved in griefing - it will be destroyed.
  - Breeders Rights:
    - Issue/Exchange their super breeds with whomever they wish.
    - There are no limitations to what you can breed.

## **Violations & Punishments**

Violations that originate from toxic behaviour will more often times result in an immediate and permanent ban. For other smaller recurring violations, admins reserve the right to issue punishments at their discretion.

If rules are being violated then you must submit proof before asking an admin to investigate. Proof can be in the form of relevant screenshots (F12 while in game to capture screen via Steam) or in the form of video if you are able to do so. Do not come to use asking for someone to be punished without proof. Do **_NOT_** leave out details just to help your case. Admins do not take kindly to lying.

You can report a violation on the [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/supremegaming) and creating a support ticket in any channel by sending a message containing `/ticket new`.

## **Additional Notes**

The rules, mods and settings are subject to be updated. We do our best to inform you of those changes, please keep an eye out in discord or in-game when we announce rule enhancements or removals.
