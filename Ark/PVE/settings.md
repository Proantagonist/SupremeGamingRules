### **Structure Decay Timers**

Instead of using Ark’s built-in decay system, we use a plugin. This has the advantage of having the same decay time on all types of structures as well as dinos. Default decay for everyone is 17 days, donors get additional time. To see the decay time of a structure, type /DecayTime in chat while looking at the structure

#### Decay timers
* Default – _17 days_
* Supporter – _20 days_
* Donor – _25 days_
* Backer – _30 days_
* Patron – _35 days_

####  Fast Decay is as follows (under 5 structures in a 10 foundation radius):
* Default – _2 days_
* Supporter – _3 days_
* Donor – _4 days_
* Backer – _5 days_
* Patron – _6 days_

#### The following structures are excluded from fast decay:
* Oil pump
* Tek oil pump
* Gas collector
* Tek gas collector
* Tree sap tap
* Tek tree sap tap

### **Ark Smart Breeding App Settings**

For those serious about their breeding game, [Ark Smart Breeding](https://github.com/cadon/ARKStatsExtractor) is a great tool to keep track of your dino generations and get the best out of your breeders. In addition, Supreme Ark runs bi-weekly Breeding Bonanza weekends where breeding settings are ramped up to 3x the normal Supreme Ark breeding rates noted above. The settings to use for the app on your end (both normal and Breeding Bonanza) are as follow:

Toggle the "event" checkbox when the server is on a Breeding Bonanza weeked, which usually happens every two weeks.
