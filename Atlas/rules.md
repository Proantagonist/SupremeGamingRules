# Global Rules

## These rules apply to both PvE and PvP grids:

1. ### **NO** derogatory chat or names (company, character, tames, ships, etc) that are racist, homophobic, against a religion or ethnicity or that are aimed at any other taboo topic.
   - If you're unsure, ask an admin PRIOR to using a name. We DO NOT include every single term you can find in Urban Dictionary or other unofficial sources and are primarily concerned with obvious and common use cases. Admins will make determinations on a case-by-case basis if there is confusion.

2. ### **NO** cheating, exploiting bugs, exploiting settings, or using 3rd party hack programs.
   - This game is in Early Access and will undoubtedly have bugs and odd workarounds. If you find one, bring it up to the attention of the admin team and we'll make a determination if it's truly an exploit or not.
   - Attempting to push a player from a PvE area into a PvP grid is considered an exploit, is strictly prohibited, and will be met with severe consequences.

3. ### **NO** harassment, griefing, camping, personal attacks, etc of other players.
   -  Arguments should be kept to a minimum. If they get out of hand an admin will step in and tell you to stop, which means you should stop immediately.

4. ### **DO NOT** argue with admin staff. 
    - When an admin asks you to do something, it is because your action was determined to be against our community goals, so please just do it. If you are unhappy with how a situation was resolved you can open a ticket to discuss the problem with the rest of the admin team. Admins must make on-the-spot decisions and we are willing to share the decisions that led to our response.

## Language

We aim to be a friendly environment and do not want excessive cursing in chat. While we understand sometimes an expletive is the best way to get your feelings across, please keep it to a minimum. Players and staff will ask you to watch your language if it becomes disruptive, so please respect their wishes. 

However, using foul language as an insult to other players is unacceptable and will be addressed by an admin was soon as we can. Please remember we can see all chat from game in Discord.

## Toxicity

While "trash talk" is many times an aspect of PvP and even sometimes PvE, if it reaches a level of you being a toxic player, you will be addessed by an admin to be mindful of your chat. If your behaviour continues to degrade or you begin to destroy the friendly and respectful environment we wish to achieve, you will be removed.

## Additional PVE Grid Rules

1. ### **DO NOT** block "enemy" flags, ports, paths, cave entrances, points of interest or major resource spawns. Do not build inside powerstone/boss caves.
   - Ensure that your build does not cripple creature or resource spawns. Leave pathways on the beaches open for players to easily traverse across even with tames. Leave ports open on all sides and do not build in their vicinity.
   - If you are found blocking in an enemy flag during a claim contest, or blocking in a player with structures, you will lose the ability to claim the island and not be allowed to re-attempt and your structures will be removed. In serious violations a total grid wipe of your company's structures will occur.

2. ### **DO NOT** spam structures for any reason. Clean up after yourself.
   - This includes but is not limited to foundations, pillars, farmhouses, etc. Spam will most likely be met with an admin removing the spam, and in serious cases a total grid wipe of your company's structures will occur.
   - Clean up any traps or temporary buildings you've placed, especially in freeports.

3. ### **DO NOT** block in a player's expansion. Don't be a jerk island owner.
   - If you are on someone else's island, do not block them in. Please build a reasonable distance away from their main settlement and communicate with them on expansion. Players pay gold every 12 hours to own the land and they have the rights to first expansion. If you are the owner of an island, make sure you allow others to build and expand within reason.

4. ### **DO NOT** steal from containers, farmhouses, crafting stations, etc.
   - A player caught stealing from containers in PvE will most likely result in a ban. If an island owner is destroying crafting stations of other players during their "removal period" and taking resources, chances are it will result in the removal of that person's ownership of the island.

<br> 

### Island Ownership

While you have the rights to first expansion as an island owner, you cannot ask structures or bases to be removed simply because you wish to build there. There is a timer for island owners to allow them to remove temporary traps and spam for a short time, this **DOES NOT** mean you can destroy anyone's base for any reason you want. 

Play respectfully or your claim to the territory will be removed and you will not be allowed to reclaim the island.

## PVP Grids and What to Expect

PvP grids follow all the GLOBAL RULES stated above, otherwise the PvP grids are generally lawless in nature. This is to allow the best pirate experience possible while still promoting a less toxic environment than official servers.

> ONLY ENTER PVP IF YOU ARE ABSOLUTELY READY FOR CONSTANT ENGAGEMENT

* Do not enter PvP "simply to gather materials" - **you will be attacked**
* Do not enter PvP "simply to cross to the other side" - **you will be attacked**
* Do not build in PvP "simply to take advantage of the rates" - **you will be attacked**
* Do not set your war timer to a timeframe when you are not online - **you will be raided**
