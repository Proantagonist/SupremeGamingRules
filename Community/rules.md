# **COMMUNITY AND DISCORD RULES**

### 1.) NO derogatory chat or names.
Anything racist, homophobic, against a religion or ethnicity or any other taboo topic will not be tolerated.

### 2.) Take arguments to Private Message
Do not argue excessively in chat. If a personal argument begins to happen, please take it to PM.

### 3.) DO NOT harass other community members
Be respectful and courteous. Don't constantly badger other players or feel the need to remark on everything they say.

### 4.) DO NOT spam, advertise other servers, or post NSFW content outside of the appropriate channels.
You may advertise another Discord if an admin allows it (usually given for mod Discords or developer Discords). NSFW channels are marked as such and are the only place you may post that type of material.

### 5.) Familiarise yourself with the procedures and guidelines in [community-support](https://discord.com/channels/255064535222714368/634562293966962699) for how to get help with an issue.
Simply asking "is an admin on" or "I need an admin" will generally go unanswered in general chat. Many of your questions can be answered by the community without the need to ping an admin. Please follow the procedures and guidelines posted for how to get the best assistance.

### 6.) You must assign yourself the appropriate role for your game in [role-assignment](https://discord.com/channels/255064535222714368/534281558379462695) to open the channels available.
Don't constantly post in general chat because you refuse to assign yourself a role. If the role assignment channel does not work for you, please refer to the support channel.
