# **Community Support**


### A Note on Admin Support
There are several admins who volunteer their time to the enforcement of these rules. We do this because we believe in our community and we want it to be a fun place for people to play. Having said that, it is not our full-time JOB to perform admin actions in-game. We are also players, just like you, and while we will try to address violations as quickly as possible, it is not guaranteed everything will be taken care of right away. Please be patient and understanding.

## Discord

The best way to get any kind of support for any of the services hosted by Supreme Gaming is through our [discord server](https://discord.supremegaming.gg). If your inquiry is for general information your best bet is to ask your question in the appropriate game chanel. There are many amazing members in the community that are happy and eager to help each other so often times the community can answer general question much faster than an admin. For assistance requiring in-game intervention please create a ticket.

## Creating a Discord Support Ticket

There are various `#bot-spam` channels on the discord server. In one of those channels:

- Open a ticket in Discord by typing `!ticket new` and follow the link to the channel it creates for you.
- Follow the instructions given in your new ticket channel which will include describing your situation and providing travel coordinates if applicable.
- If your ticket is in regards to a rule violation, please provide proof using screenshots, videos and any other items you can provide as evidence to your claim. **Without clear proof of a violation we will be hard pressed to take action**.

**DO NOT** omit information that could possibly put you in a position of also violating a rule. If you omit information, which we will most likely find during our investigation, we are much less likely to take action as it will seem like an attempt to deceive the admin staff into believing information that is not accurate
