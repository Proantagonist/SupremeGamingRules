# Supreme's FAQ

#### 1. Why can't my ship lift off the ground?
    - Assuming it has enough power and thrust to actually lift off, if it's a small grid ship, the server might think part of it is in the voxels, and needs to be dug out. If it's large grid, same thing but also it might think the grid is a station, which would require converting to ship in the Info tab.

### 2. Why did my ship disappear?
    - Grid cleanup is run every hour. Use !cleanup ingame to see what all gets cleaned up. The main thing is removing grids with the default name ("Small Grid XXXX" and "Large Grid XXXX") if no players are nearby, so be sure to rename your grids if you want to keep them.

### 3. Are in-game scripts enabled?
    - Yes, the Programmable Block and in-game scripts are enabled. The only restriction with their use is to not use scripts with the express purpose of degrading server performance.
