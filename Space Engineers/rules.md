## Rules & Guidelines:

1. ### No hate speech of any kind, either in game or in Discord.

2. ### Keep swearing to a reasonable level, every other word doesn't need to be a curse.

3. ### Do not create structures/ships with the intention of degrading the server's sim speed. Pointless programmable blocks, timer loops, etc. Offending grids will be removed.

4. ### PVP is only to take place within PVP zones. The plugin used to manage this prevents most hostile actions, but it's not perfect. Do not try to subvert its limitations.

## PVP Rules:

1. ### At present there is only one PVP zone
    - Centered at the center of Saturn at GPS:Saturn:-377740.3:49259.7:1642259.9: and extending to a 40km radius. This includes the entire planet's surface, all of its gravity well, and a fair distance of 0g.

2. ### All's fair in Clang and war, in the context of the game. Losing a ship to someone's rocket barrage is no excuse to take your frustration out on them in other ways.

3. ### Remote drones, autonomous missile strikes, and other methods of assault that keep you away from the target are allowed, **_IF_** the launching vessel is also within the PVP zone.

**Violations that originate from toxic behavior will more often times result in an immediate and permanent ban. For other smaller recurring violations, admins reserve the right to issue punishments at their discretion.**
